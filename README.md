Current state (last update Connor 11/9 19:30): \
\
npm/React projects initialized, and can be run (use npm run dev in /website/vite-project) \
\
main.jsx is the current front-end hub, I'm working on a search bar to center the site around. \
\
app.jsx currently has the home menu, complete with a search bar and navbar (that only has the name in it atm, but comments include stuff for future additions if desired). \
\
CSS is currently an adaptation of Bootstrap's official setup. See links below for documentation of both Bootstrap and their CSS: \
\

\

Installed React-Select, a project that allows a better search bar to be used (that can hopefully implement autocomplete), find the documentation <a href='https://react-select.com/home'> here </a>!
